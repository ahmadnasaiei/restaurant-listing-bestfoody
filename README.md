## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: API Base URL Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è
The mock API was done locally on json-server and testing the app on a physical device (or emulator) will need you to update the BASE_URL in your API configuration file (e.g., services/RestaurantAPI.js) from:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';
```

To your local IPv4 address (found via ipconfig on Windows or ifconfig on macOS/Linux), for example:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.1.xxxx:3000';
```
